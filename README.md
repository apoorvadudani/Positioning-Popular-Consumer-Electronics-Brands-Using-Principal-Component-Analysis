## Background

I analyze consumer brand perception survey data for popular consumer electronic device brands. This data reflects consumer ratings of brands with regard to perceptual adjectives as expressed on survey items with the following form:

On a scale from 1 to 10—where 1 is least and 10 is most—how [ADJECTIVE] is [BRAND A]?

In this dataset, an observation is one respondent’s rating of a brand on one of the adjectives. Two such items might be:
1. How trendy is Sony?
2. How much of a category leader is Bose?

Such ratings are collected for all the combinations of adjectives and brands of interest.

The data here comprise simulated ratings of 10 brands on 9 adjectives (“performance,” “leader,” “latest,” “fun,” and so forth), for N = 100 simulated respondents.
